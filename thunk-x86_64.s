/*
    "PRE" mocks allow us to call a python function before the C function
    it "mocks".  We do this by having a third "thunk" function, which
    calls both, and put the address of that function in the GOT.

    This is a bit tricky, because the contents of the stack and registers
    are set up with the args to the second function when we land in the
    thunk, so we can't push anything or modify any registers before
    invoking the python function if we want to provide access to the
    args to the mock. So, we need to manipulate the slot on the stack
    containing the return address from the thunk.

    Each (64-bit) PRE thunk consists of two contiguous pages of memory,
    the first is executable, the second is writeable. The second page is
    used to store the addresses of the two functions we want to call,
    and a stack to save argument-passing registers and the eventual
    return while the first thunk executes.  We grow the stack from the
    end of the data page towards the code page, so that if we overflow,
    we'll reliably fault.

*/

# offsets into the second page. We have 2048 4-byte words of memory in our 8k,
# use the end of the page for structured data, and the rest as a stack for return
# addresses

.set STACKP,1020 * 8
.set GOTENT,1021 * 8 # location of the GOT entry we're thunking.
.set CALLBACK1,1022 * 8
.set CALLBACK2,1023 * 8

x86_64 ABI:

We don't have many free registers to play with.

rax  - potentially count of args in varargs
rbx  - callee saved
rcx  - arg #4
rdx  - arg #3
rsi  - arg #2
rdi  - arg #1
rbp  - calle saved (poss. frame pointer)
rsp  - stack pointer
r8   - arg #5
r9   - arg #6
r10  - chain pointer
r11  - temporary
r12  - callee-saved
r13  - callee-saved
r14  - callee-saved
r15  - callee-saved

So, we have r11, and everything else needs to be preserved.
